Survival Instinct: Hey, piggy-piggy!  Wake up!  This does not look like a safe place to be in.

- [stare at the figure menacingly]

Survival Instinct: Yeah I know that look. Unfortunately, being angry will not get you off this beach.

Survival Instinct: Look, I was out all day yesterday - what the hell happened? Where are we?

- I feel like I am in Spain. The S is silent.
- I have no clue - do you?

Survival Instinct: So no clue, huh. Looks like a beach to me. There seems to be a farm up ahead.

Survival Instinct: How do you feel?

- There’s quite a bit of pain in my everywhere.
- Get lost, Survival Instinct, Let me be. => END

Survival Instinct: Yeah, I thought as much. Can you move?

- I’m not sure I can. Or if I know how to?
